# Lab 3 Report

A short summary of my thoughts process while working through the lab 3 assignment.

## Personal information class

In this exercise, I created a person class by initializing **init** method that creates the class data attributes.
This is followed by accessor methods to retrieve the data attributes and mutator methods to assign values or change the data attributes. I then created a **str** method that represents the class as a string so as to be able to print the instance of the class .
finally, I created three instance variables using the class constructor
This exercise was easy since it was similar to the car class we created in the lecture.

## Pet class

Similar to the person class, the pet class was also easy tp create. I initialized the pet class with the **init** method followed by the mututor and accessor methods and then the **str** method.
The second part of the exercise was a little bit challenging especially on how to store the objects in a list. I initially was not able to display what is in the list until I added the **str** method in the pet class.
Also, It was challenging to figure out how to display only a certain type of pets. I finally found that I can compare the user input to the accessor method in the pet class (in this case the get_animal_type method)

Overall, classes comstruction was straightforward for both exercises and the only challenging part was storing the objects in a list and displaying them depending on the user input.
