In this exercise, I have answered each question using functions, 
the purpose is just to separate echa question from the other questions.
the main function holds all the other functions '''

# Exercise 1: DVD CLUB POINTS
# A program that displays the user earnings based on the number of dvd purchased

    #Asking the user for number of videos  purchased and converting it into int 
    videos_purchased =int( input("How many videos did you purchase this month?: "))

    # about of how much they earned

# A program that calculates the BMI  for a user
